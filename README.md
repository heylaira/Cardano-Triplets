# Cardano-Triplets
Code in python to find the Cardano Triplets that respect and certain conditional expression


A triplet of positive integers (a,b,c) is called a Cardano Triplet if it satisfies the condition:

[(a+b*(cˆ(1/2)))ˆ(1/3)] + [(a-b*(cˆ(1/2)))ˆ(1/3)] = 1

For example, (2,1,5) is a Cardano Triplet.

There exist 149 Cardano Triplets for which a+b+c<=1000.

Find how many Cardano Triplets exist such that a+b+c<=n .
